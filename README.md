Alright, let me tackle this README request for the 'Smart Security Entrance' project. The user wants a comprehensive documentation without contribution or license info, and a note about diagram accuracy. They also mentioned including a pinmap if possible.

First, the project title. The original name is '24. Smart Security Entrance', but I should make the title more concise. Maybe "Smart Security Entrance System with Access Control" ‚Äì checks the 50-character limit.

Next, the description. Looking at the code snippets, the system uses sensors like IR, ultrasonic, and MLX90614 for temperature. It controls a servo for a gate and has an LCD display. The description needs to explain these components and their roles in access control.

Pin mapping is essential. From the code:
- IR sensors on A0 and A1
- Servo on pin 3
- Buzzer on 4
- Ultrasonic's trig and echo on 5 and 6
- LCD uses pins 7-12 as per LiquidCrystal setup (RS, E, D4-D7)

I should list these in a table for clarity. Need to check if the LCD pins are correctly mapped. The code initializes LiquidCrystal(12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7), which corresponds to RS, E, D4, D5, D6, D7. So pin 12 is RS, 11 is E, then D4 to D7 on 10,9,8,7. That's correct.

Include a note about diagrams possibly not being accurate to cover any future changes or user errors.

Project Structure: List the main code file (SecurityEnterance.ino) and mention other possible files like PDFs (schematics, user manual) even though the user didn't provide specifics. They listed "list of pdf files:" but didn't add any, so maybe just leave a placeholder or mention that related documentation can be added later.

Code Overview: Explain the key components used and their functions. Highlight the flow ‚Äì detecting presence, temperature check, access granted/denied.

Operations: Break down the event states from the code. Events 0 to 4 represent different stages (idle, detected, temp check, allowed, denied). Explain each briefly.

Add the note about temperature threshold (100¬∞F) and that it's adjustable, giving flexibility.

Avoid contribution guidelines and licensing as per the user's request.

Finally, verify that all provided code elements are addressed and that the README is structured logically. Make sure the pinmap is accurate based on the code, and the note about diagrams is present. Check for any markdown formatting issues to ensure readability on GitHub.
# Smart Security Entrance System with Access Control

## Overview
A smart entrance control system using Arduino that combines presence detection, temperature screening, and access management. Designed for secure environments requiring health checks (e.g., fever detection) before entry.

## Features
- üë• Dual IR sensor people counting
- üå°Ô∏è MLX90614 non-contact temperature screening
- üö™ Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) for proximity detection
- üîî Visual feedback via 16x2 LCD + audible alerts
- üîí Servo-controlled physical gate mechanism
- üìä Automatic people counting with entry validation

## Hardware Pin Configuration
| Component        | Arduino Pin |
|------------------|-------------|
| IR Sensor 1      | A0          |
| IR Sensor 2      | A1          |
| Servo Motor      | 3           |
| Buzzer           | 4           |
| Ultrasonic Trig  | 5           |
| Ultrasonic Echo  | 6           |
| LCD RS           | 12          |
| LCD E            | 11          |
| LCD D4-D7        | 10,9,8,7    |

*Note: Connection diagrams in project PDFs may show illustrative representations rather than exact wiring.*

## System Workflow
1. **Idle State**: 
   - Displays total entries
   - Monitors ultrasonic sensor for approaching users

2. **Presence Detection**:
   - Activates when object detected 5-25cm away
   - 10-second timeout for approach confirmation

3. **Health Check**:
   - Requires IR beam break confirmation
   - Measures body temperature (‚Ñâ) via thermal sensor
   - Threshold: 100¬∞F (customizable in code)

4. **Access Control**:
   - **
